                <li><a href="recipes/carbonara.html">French carbonara</a><p>: The French recipe for carbonara is rather unique as it uses heavy cream ("cr√®me fraiche") and matchstick size lardons rather than bacon or porcetta.</p></li>
                <li><a href="recipes/french-onion-soup.html">French Onion Soup</a><p>: Our French onion soup is deliciously rich and easy to make at home. This savoury soup is perfect for using up a garden glut and great for dinner parties.</p></li>
                <li><a href="recipes/chicken-milanese.html">Chicken Milanese</a><p>: I made this chicken Milanese after I couldn't find a recipe that would work with pasta. It's crispy, quick to make, and delicious!</p></li>
